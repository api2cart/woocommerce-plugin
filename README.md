Our connector plugins trigger a push-a-button connection and thus eliminate the inconvenience of sharing logins, passwords, and all kinds of keys.

WooCommerce Plugin Installation

1) Go to the WordPress admin panel. 
2) Find the Plugins tab, navigate the cursor to it, and choose Add New. 
3) Press the Upload Plugin button. 
4) Press the Choose File button. Find the connector archive and click on Install Now. 
5) Now activate the plugin by clicking the corresponding link on the left bottom of the plugin box. 
6) Find the connector in the list of installed plugins and go to Settings.

Service enhancement takes research, data collection, and analysis. That is why we added a snipped of tracking code into our plugins. It gets activated after the connector has been installed. It does not track any personal data and serves as a statistics means only.
